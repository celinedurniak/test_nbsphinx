Introduction
============


*QENSmodels* is a repository containing `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ models
( *i.e.*, mathematical functions) that can be used to fit Quasi Elastic Neutron
Scattering (QENS) data `S(Q, omega)`.


This project has received funding from the European Union’s
Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 654000.


Getting started
===============


To get a glimpse of what can be done with the library, click on `launch binder` below.
Please note that the notebooks can be slow to load.

Install the QENS models
-----------------------

Currently the QENS models library has not been released on pypi. Please use the alternative
method described below to install it.

- If not already installed on your computer, download and install Python (version>=3.8),
for example, from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
  In the following instructions, replace `python` by the path to the version of python
you want to use.

- Create and go to, e.g., QENSmodels directory (optional)

  .. code-block:: console

      mkdir QENSmodels && cd QENSmodels


- Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional)

  .. code-block:: console

      python -m venv .venv
      source .venv/bin/activate


  Note that the prompt of the terminal will change and contain ``(.venv)``.
  You can choose the folder name that contains your virtual environment when you create it by
  passing a name other than `.venv`. Once done working with this virtual environment, you can
  deactivate it by typing ``deactivate``.


- Upgrade pip (optional)

  .. code-block:: console

     python -m pip install --upgrade pip

- Install the library

   - *method 1*: if you want to modify the models at a later stage

      - download or clone the repository at https://github.com/QENSlibrary/QENSmodels

      - In a terminal run

        .. code-block:: console

           python -m pip install -e full_path_to_QENSmodels_folder --use-feature=in-tree-build


   - *method 2*: if you only want to use the version of the models available in the repository

     .. code-block:: console

        python -m pip install git+https://github.com/QENSlibrary/QENSmodels.git@master


    See `the documentation on pip install <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/>`_
    for additional information. Run ``pip show QENSmodels`` to display details about the installed package.



To **test the installation**\ , type the following command in a terminal

.. code-block:: console

   python -c "import QENSmodels"




To **uninstall** the library, type

.. code-block:: console

   python -m pip uninstall QENSmodels



Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available at https://qensmodels.readthedocs.io .

Note that the Jupyter notebooks are available in the repository in the `docs/examples` folder.
But they require the installation of additional libraries. Please refer to the README file in
the same folder for instructions.


Quick example to use the models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   import QENSmodels
   value = QENSmodels.lorentzian(1, 1, 1, 1)



Physical units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For information about unit conversion, please refer to the jupyter notebook called
`Convert_units.ipynb` in the `tools` folder.
