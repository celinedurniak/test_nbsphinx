Introduction
============


*QENSmodels* is a repository containing models (mathematical functions) written in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_.
These models can be used to fit Quasi Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) data `S(Q, omega)`.
This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon
2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 654000.

Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Python modules to use the models:


* `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
* `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_

Python modules to test the models (for contributors):


* `flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ 
* `unittest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_
* `doctest <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/doctest.html>`_

Additional modules are required to run the examples. Details can be
found in the `README file <https://github.com/QENSlibrary/QENSmodels/blob/master/examples/README.rst>`_ of the *examples* folder.

How to install?
---------------

.. NOTE:: If you want to use a virtual environment, please go to
   `this link <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html>`_ for instructions.

The steps to follow are:  


* Download or clone the repository which can be found at the following `link <https://github.com/QENSlibrary/QENSmodels>`_

* To **install the package**, type the following
  command in a terminal  

  .. code-block:: console

     python -m pip install full_path_to_QENSmodels_folder


See `the documentation on pip install <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs>`_ for 
additional information. Run ``pip show QENSmodels`` to display details about the installed package.

To **test the installation**\ , type the following command in a terminal

.. code-block:: console

   python -c "import QENSmodels"

To **uninstall** the library, type

.. code-block:: console

   pip uninstall QENSmodels

Documentation
=============

The documentation is available at https://qensmodels.readthedocs.io .

.. The documentation is built using ``Sphinx``. The required packages can be installed using the following commands:

.. .. code-block:: console

..    pip install sphinx
..    pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
..    pip install sphinxcontrib-napoleon

.. Other ways of installing ``Sphinx`` at be found at http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html

.. How to build documentation?
.. ---------------------------

.. In a terminal, move to the *docs* folder and type

.. .. code-block:: console

..    make html

.. This command will generate html files in the subfolder *_build/html*.

Tests
=====

The script to run the tests is located in the ``tools`` folder. 
These tests require the installation of ``doctest`` and ``unittest``.

In a terminal, move to the ``tools`` directory and run

.. code-block:: console

   ./run_tests.sh

How to use the library?
-----------------------

.. code-block:: python

   import QENSmodels
   value = QENSmodels.lorentzian(1, 1, 1, 1)

or copy and paste the script related to the Lorentzian function.

The scripts of the models can be found in the
`git repository <https://github.com/QENSlibrary/QENSmodels>`_.

Jupyter notebooks showing how to use some of the QENS models are located in the *examples*
folder. The name of the notebook indicates which fitting engine and QENS model 
are used. Additional tools might have to be installed in order to use a 
particular notebook. Please refer to the README file in the `examples` folder for details.

If you do not want to download neither install any component, one example can be interactively tested online.

To open it, click on `launch binder` below. Please note that the notebook can be slow to load.
